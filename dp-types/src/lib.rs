//! # dp-types — a differential-privacy budget, and the quantitative axis
//!
//! Corona **leaf 28**, and — as of this leaf — the garden's first on the **quantitative
//! axis**. Every residue the garden has mapped so far is **binary**: a witness is sound or it
//! is forged, a budget is spent or unspent, a snapshot is fresh or stale. Differential
//! privacy is different in kind — it is a *graded* guarantee, one that holds **"to within
//! `ε`"**. An `ε`-differentially-private mechanism promises that adding or removing one
//! individual's record changes the distribution of outputs by at most a factor `e^ε`; `ε`
//! is a real-valued **privacy budget**, small `ε` is strong privacy, and every query you
//! answer *spends* some of it. This leaf asks the garden's standing question of that graded
//! world: **does a privacy budget reduce to the compile-primitive vocabulary?**
//!
//! The answer is a **three-way split** (∥ `frost-types`, leaf 12) into three *concerns*, **no
//! new primitive**: **(1)** budget non-duplication + sequential composition reduce to
//! **[E0382]**, **(2)** the static ceiling reduces to **[E0080]**, and **(3)** the
//! `ε`-*guarantee* itself (noise calibrated to sensitivity) does **not** reduce — a proof
//! obligation handed to Sol. Two of the three concerns reduce to a compile primitive; the
//! third — the graded core — is the leaf's point. (The released answer is *additionally*
//! sealed by **[E0451]**, and the E0308 brand is unused: **three** primitives are *touched*,
//! but only **two** of the three *concerns* reduce.)
//!
//! ## The budget is (as of this leaf) the garden's first *continuous, divisible* resource
//!
//! Before the reduction, the datum that makes this leaf new. Every resource the garden has
//! tracked so far is **discrete**: a k-of-n **count** (`threshold`, leaf 1), a use-once
//! **capability** (`lamport`, leaf 5; `ratchet`, leaf 10), an **epoch** (`accumulator`,
//! leaf 11). A privacy budget is a **real number** `ε ∈ ℝ⁺`, and — the sharper novelty — it
//! is **divisible**: it can be partitioned into sub-budgets `ε₁ + ε₂ = ε` that are then
//! spent independently ([`Budget::split`]). So the resource is not just continuous but
//! *arithmetic*: it adds and subtracts, and it conserves under partition. Nothing earlier in
//! the garden is a quantity you can arithmetically divide and conserve.
//!
//! One DP term is worth pinning down up front, because it is easy to over-claim:
//! [`Budget::split`] is **sub-allocation**, *not* **parallel composition** in the DP sense.
//! Sub-allocation conserves the **sum** (`ε₁ + ε₂ = ε`) and each part depletes on its own —
//! the additive story. True parallel composition earns a *discount*: over **disjoint** data
//! partitions the total cost is the **max** of the per-partition `ε`, not the sum. That
//! discount is a fact about disjoint *data*, which this toy does not model, so it is
//! deliberately **not** implemented here — `split` is the sum-conserving partition, and the
//! max-saving parallel form is out of scope.
//!
//! ## (1) Non-duplication + sequential composition reduce to [E0382]
//!
//! [`Budget`] is a **linear** value: it is **not** `Clone`/`Copy`, and [`Budget::run`]
//! takes `self` **by value**. Answering a query consumes the budget and returns a *new, no
//! larger* one (strictly smaller for any charge above the budget's float granularity — see
//! "the arithmetic residue" below):
//!
//! ```text
//! run(self, cost, mechanism, answer, seed) -> Result<(Released, Budget), SpendError>
//! ```
//!
//! Because the old budget is *moved into* `run`, no live binding reaches it afterward, so
//! the same `ε` **cannot be spent twice** — the second use is a compile error
//! (`error[E0382]: use of moved value`; see the `compile_fail` doctest). This echoes how the
//! two **linear-typed** privacy languages, **Fuzz** (Reed–Pierce, ICFP 2010) and **DFuzz**
//! (Gaboardi et al., POPL 2013 — Fuzz extended with lightweight *dependent* types), track
//! privacy. In Fuzz what lives in the graded-linear type is a function's **sensitivity** (a
//! scaling modality on inputs); the privacy cost `ε` is charged *on top of* that sensitivity
//! discipline, through a probability monad. The **shared mechanism** is the honest core of
//! the analogy: **no *free* contraction** — you may not *fork* an input and pay its
//! sensitivity (hence its `ε`) only once. Rust's move checker is an **affine** discipline
//! (use *at most* once; dropping an unused value is fine), weaker than Fuzz's graded-linear
//! types — where `!_r` *meters* duplication at summed sensitivity cost rather than forbidding
//! it outright — but coinciding with them on exactly this point: neither lets you copy a
//! value *for free*. So a budget re-use is caught before it runs. Another E0382 leaf, a *reuse*-kind catastrophe
//! (leaf 5's family — "spend twice") — and the first where the linear resource is a
//! continuous *magnitude* rather than a discrete token.
//!
//! Note the deliberate witness-species contrast (∥ leaf 12's redacted share vs one-time
//! nonce): a **cost** ([`Epsilon`]) is freely `Copy` — a number is evidence, you may read
//! it as often as you like — while the **budget** it is charged against is linear. The two
//! sit side by side in [`Budget::run`]'s signature, Copy argument and moved receiver.
//!
//! ## (2) The static *ceiling* reduces to [E0080] — when the costs are compile-time known
//!
//! If a query plan's costs are known at compile time, the ceiling moves there. [`StaticBudget`]
//! is a `const fn` newtype over **fixed-point micro-`ε`** (`ε × 10⁶`, an integer because
//! const-eval arithmetic is cleanest on integers), and [`StaticBudget::spend`] does a
//! `checked_sub`, `panic!`-ing on `None`. Evaluate a plan in a `const` context and an
//! overspend **panics during const-eval** — a compile error, [E0080] — so **sequential
//! composition sums at compile time**:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0080
//! use dp_types::StaticBudget;
//! // 60 + 60 micro-ε charged against a 100 micro-ε ceiling: the sum overshoots, and the
//! // overspend is caught while the constant is evaluated — error[E0080].
//! const _OVERSPENT: StaticBudget = StaticBudget::new(100).spend(60).spend(60);
//! ```
//!
//! This is `static-config-types` (leaf 6) applied to a *depleting* budget: the same
//! invariant `1 ≤ k ≤ n` walled at compile time is here `Σ cost ≤ budget`, walled the same
//! way. The **split with the runtime layer** mirrors leaf 6 exactly: a *compile-time* plan
//! gets an E0080 wall, a *runtime-chosen* `ε` (data-dependent, adaptive) falls back to
//! [`Budget::run`]'s runtime [`SpendError::Overspent`] check — the **count residue** (leaf 1)
//! in a graded costume. And a *quantitative* subtlety the discrete leaves never met: the static layer
//! must **quantize** real `ε` to integer micro-`ε`, and that rounding is itself a tiny
//! residue — round the ceiling *down* and you are conservative (safe), round it *up* and you
//! have silently *loosened* privacy. The wall is exact on the integers it is given; whether
//! those integers faithfully under-approximate the real budget is beneath it.
//!
//! ## (3) The `ε` *guarantee* does **not** reduce — calibration is a proof, and a trap
//!
//! Layers (1) and (2) enforce the **accounting**: the budget is spent at most once and
//! never overshoots its ceiling. But `ε` only *means privacy* if the noise a mechanism adds
//! is **calibrated to the query's sensitivity** `Δf` — the most one individual can move the
//! true answer. The Laplace mechanism adds noise of scale `Δf / ε`; get `Δf` wrong (too
//! small) and you add too little noise, so the released answer leaks more than `ε` allows —
//! while the budget arithmetic stays perfectly honest. **No compile-time fact can witness
//! that a mechanism's noise matches the true sensitivity of an arbitrary query function.**
//! That is a semantic property of the function, exactly the shape of `crdt-types` (leaf 15):
//! a **proof obligation over the real domain**, Sol's territory. And it is simultaneously
//! the garden's recurring **witness-trap** (leaf 27's conversion `FACTOR`, leaf 5's
//! type-vs-backend split): the type forces you to *declare and pay* a cost, it never checks
//! that the *noise you added* earns it.
//!
//! This is executable. The [`Mechanism`] trait reports a `sensitivity()`; a **correct**
//! mechanism reports the true `Δf`, a **sloppy** one under-reports it — and *both satisfy
//! the same trait, both are accepted by [`Budget::run`], both deduct the same `ε`.* Only a
//! statistical test on the outputs — never the compiler — can tell the private mechanism
//! from the leaky one. The `the_type_charges_epsilon_but_never_checks_calibration` test
//! builds both and shows the sloppy mechanism adding an order of magnitude too little noise
//! for the very same charge (∥ leaf 15's `min`/`+` impostors type-checking as a "merge",
//! and leaf 27's `SloppyFeet` compiling with a wrong factor).
//!
//! ## The new datum: linear stops *duplication*, not *inflation*
//!
//! Sequential composition is E0382; **sub-allocation** is where the *continuous* nature
//! bites. [`Budget::split`] partitions `ε` into `ε₁ + ε₂` and returns **two** budgets,
//! consuming the original (so you cannot keep the whole *and* the parts — the contraction the
//! affine discipline forbids). E0382 guarantees the parts are not the original *reused*. But
//! it is **silent about arithmetic**, in two ways the type cannot see: nothing in the type
//! stops a buggy `split` body from handing out `ε₁ + ε₂ > ε` and **inflating** the budget
//! from nothing, and nothing in the type stops a **negative** cost — a sign the compiler
//! never inspects — from *adding* to the budget on its way through [`Budget::run`] (a
//! negative cost sails past the `cost > remaining` ceiling, since `-5 > 1` is false). Both
//! are therefore **runtime checks**: `split`'s body conserves the sum, and both `run` and
//! `split` reject any cost that is not a positive, finite real with
//! [`SpendError::InvalidCost`]. Same
//! quantitative residue as calibration, now on the *plumbing* rather than the noise.
//! Linearity is about *identity* (this value is used at most once); it is silent about
//! *magnitude and sign* (the numbers add up, and they are non-negative). A discrete token has
//! no magnitude to conserve, so no earlier leaf could surface this; a divisible real quantity
//! is the first that can — which is why the sign guard is not a mere patch but the thesis in
//! miniature: **the linear type guards identity; arithmetic is a runtime residue.**
//!
//! ## The arithmetic residue, one level deeper: finite precision
//!
//! Push that thought one notch further and the sharpest form appears: the *runtime* check is
//! itself `f64`, so the accounting is honest only down to the float's granularity. Two
//! consequences — both **disclosed limits of the toy**, neither a break of the type-level
//! guarantees (which held under every adversarial probe):
//!
//! - **A sub-granularity charge does not deplete.** A positive cost below the ULP of
//!   `remaining` (e.g. `1e-20` against a `1.0` budget) satisfies `cost > 0`, yet `remaining -
//!   cost == remaining` *exactly*, so the budget does not move — which is why the promise
//!   above is "*no larger*", strictly smaller only above the granularity. Enough such charges
//!   compose to unbounded real privacy loss while the *recorded* budget stands still. This is
//!   inherent to a *continuous* budget held in `f64`: the price of `ε ∈ ℝ⁺` is a
//!   finite-precision floor. The honest fix is *integer* budget units — which is also why
//!   [`StaticBudget`] carries micro-`ε` as a `u32` (chosen there for clean const-eval, but the
//!   integer choice dodges this ULP floor too); a graduated runtime budget would do the same.
//! - **A `Released` value can be non-finite.** As `ε → 0` the noise scale `Δf/ε → ∞` (faithful
//!   DP — perfect privacy *is* infinite noise), so a *sufficiently* tiny valid `ε` (subnormal
//!   territory, small enough that `Δf/ε` overflows `f64` — a merely small `ε` like `1e-15`
//!   stays finite), or a mechanism reporting a non-finite sensitivity, or a non-finite
//!   `answer`, yields a non-finite release. The [E0451] seal witnesses that a budget was *charged*, never that the released
//!   number is finite or calibrated — the same "the seal is only as strong as its checked
//!   path" the calibration residue already named.
//!
//! Both are the quantitative axis telling the truth about itself: a continuous resource in
//! finite precision keeps a magnitude blind spot the type never had a chance to hold.
//!
//! ## What this leaf adds to the map
//!
//! The first residue on the **quantitative axis** the garden has mapped — a third meta-axis
//! beside the safety/liveness axis (leaf 24) and the value/operational-layer axis (leaf 25).
//! Every prior residue answers "does the property *hold*?"; this one answers "does it hold *to
//! within `ε`*, and is that `ε` *earned*?", and the graded core (calibration, conservation)
//! is exactly the part the binary vocabulary cannot hold. Three primitives, each doing its
//! home job — **[E0382]** (linear budget, central), **[E0080]** (static ceiling, ∥ leaf 6),
//! **[E0451]** ([`Released`] is a sealed token minted only by a charged budget) — plus the
//! **Sol obligation** (calibration) and the **witness-trap** (calibration *and*
//! conservation). The **brand is honestly unused**: a budget has no provenance scope to
//! pen, no two-snapshot relation to relate. That a domain as far from k-of-n secret sharing
//! as *statistical privacy* still lands on the same three primitives — reserving only its
//! *graded* core for a proof — is the leaf's contribution.
//!
//! ## The codes, verified out of band
//!
//! As leaf 27 established, `rustdoc`'s `compile_fail` checks only that a snippet *fails*,
//! ignoring the `,EXXXX` annotation. So the codes below are documentation, **verified by
//! direct `rustc`**; the doctests guard against the examples silently *compiling*.
//!
//! - **[E0382]** — spending a moved budget (non-duplication):
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0382
//! use dp_types::{Budget, Epsilon, Counting};
//! let b = Budget::new(1.0);
//! let (_a, _b2) = b.run(Epsilon(0.5), &Counting, 42.0, 7).unwrap();
//! // `b` was moved into the first `run`; charging it again is a compile error.
//! let (_c, _b3) = b.run(Epsilon(0.5), &Counting, 42.0, 8).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! - **[E0451]** — forging a [`Released`] token past the sealed field (no charged budget):
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0451
//! use dp_types::Released;
//! // `Released`'s field is private; only `Budget::run` mints one. A struct literal from
//! // outside the crate cannot name the field — error[E0451] (field is private).
//! let _forged = Released { value: 123.0 };
//! ```
