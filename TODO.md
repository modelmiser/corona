# Corona — TODO

Single source of truth for outstanding work. Read at session start; update after
work (complete tasks, add children, keep siblings).

## Now

- [x] Scaffold workspace: `corona-core` (thin core) + `threshold-types` (leaf 1)
- [x] Leaf 1 rung 1: Shamir k-of-n, unforgeable `Secret` (E0451), GF(256) toy backend
- [x] Gates green: 10 unit + 3 doctests, clippy -D warnings, rustdoc -D warnings, fmt
- [x] CHARTER.md (two tracks + graduation criteria + Sol wiring), README
- [x] First commit (`d0bfc3b`, local, on `main`)
- [x] Push to GitHub — **public** at https://github.com/modelmiser/corona

## Next (leaf 1)

- [x] Cold-review the rung-1 surface to convergence — 5 rounds (MOD 3→1→1→0→0),
      two consecutive clean rounds. Fixes: redacting `Debug`, caller-chosen-k
      disclosure (+ test), live `combine_with` seam (+ test), thesis/wiring precision.
- [ ] `split` that takes an RNG (feature-gated) so the happy path isn't coeff-by-hand,
      while keeping `split_with_coeffs` as the deterministic/testable primitive
- [x] Decide: base for VSS rung 2 (chosen) → seeded `vss-types` (leaf 2)

## Now (leaf 2 — vss-types)

- [x] Seed VSS rung 2: Feldman verifiable secret sharing, sealed `VerifiedShare`
      (E0451) via `Commitment::verify`, threshold pinned by commitment length.
      Closes leaf 1's two limits. 12 unit + 2 doctests; full-workspace gates green.
- [x] `corona-core` promotion check (leaf-2 trigger): only `Threshold` stays shared;
      redacting-`Secret` kept per-leaf (semantically distinct). See CHARTER.
- [x] Cold-review the leaf-2 surface to convergence — 3 rounds (MOD 3→0→0), two
      consecutive clean rounds. Round 1 caught a REAL bug (non-canonical share
      index aliasing → f_inv(0)); fixed with a `verify` canonicalization guard +
      regression test. Rest were gap-characterization precision.
- [x] Brand `VerifiedShare` (bind to issuing `Commitment`) — DONE via an invariant
      *generative lifetime* (`deal_scoped`'s `for<'brand>` closure). Cross-commitment
      `recover` no longer compiles. NOTE: realized as a lifetime brand (zero-dep,
      forbid-unsafe), so the diagnostic is a *lifetime error*, not literally E0308
      (literal E0308 needs nominal type brands, un-mintable fresh per value in safe
      Rust — the lifetime diagnostic is inherent; see the WITHDRAWN note below).
- [x] Cold-review the branded leaf-2 surface to convergence — 3 rounds (MOD 3→0→0),
      two consecutive clean rounds. Branding proven sound (4 rejected exploit crates).
      Fixes: sealed `interpolate_at_zero` value-bypass + type-vs-value disclosure;
      corrected the generativity/E0308 counterfactual; `f_inv` hard-assert; MSRV pin.
- [x] ~~offer a `generativity`-backed literal-E0308 variant~~ — WITHDRAWN: the
      generativity crate also brands with lifetimes → also a lifetime error, NOT literal
      E0308. Literal E0308 needs nominal type brands (not mintable fresh per value in
      safe Rust). The lifetime diagnostic is inherent; no cleaner path exists.

## Now (leaf 3 — erasure-types)

- [x] Seed erasure-types: Reed–Solomon k-of-n erasure coding, sealed `RecoveredData`
      (E0451, non-redacting — the deliberate paired-axis contrast to `Secret`), systematic
      encode + Lagrange erasure decode over GF(256). 9 unit + 2 doctests; gates green.
- [x] `corona-core` promotion check (leaf-3 trigger): **GF(256) now shared by leaf 1 +
      leaf 3** → real promotion candidate. FLAGGED, not done (would refactor converged
      `threshold-types`). See CHARTER.
- [x] Cold-review the leaf-3 surface to convergence — 3 rounds (MOD 2→0→0), two
      consecutive clean rounds. ZERO correctness/soundness defects; all findings were
      thesis-precision (RS-is-Shamir over-claim → "same machinery, msg in evaluations
      not coefficients"; "axis invisible to the types" → invisible to the seal, visible
      in the API by convention; seal = typestate token not availability proof). Sealed
      gf256 arithmetic pub(crate).
- [x] Promote `gf256` → `corona-core` — DONE. Both leaves import `corona_core::gf256`;
      local copies deleted; canonical version = `pub` + hard `assert!`. The first
      primitive to graduate out of a leaf (thin-core rule fired at the 2nd sharing).
- [x] Error-correcting Reed–Solomon — SEEDED as `decode_correcting` (Berlekamp–Welch
      in `ecc` module) + sealed `CorrectedData`. Corrects ≤⌊(m−k)/2⌋ unknown-position
      errors; detects beyond. Integrity vs bounded corruption, NOT authentication.
- [x] Cold-review `decode_correcting` — CONVERGED (practical: 5 rounds, MOD 0→1→0→1→0,
      soundness proven 5× with ZERO correctness/soundness defects). Fixes were all
      doc-precision: CorrectedData provenance-not-correctness framing; the adversary
      threshold, which took 3 iterations to land airtight (m−t reviewer-wrong → t+1
      mine-wrong-for-odd → **d−t** = ⌈(m−k)/2⌉+1, independently re-derived correct).

## Parking lot (garden, not scheduled)

- Lean formalization of a graduated leaf → contribute to Sol (the garden↔Sol wiring)
