# Corona — TODO

Single source of truth for outstanding work. Read at session start; update after
work (complete tasks, add children, keep siblings).

## Now

- [x] Scaffold workspace: `corona-core` (thin core) + `threshold-types` (leaf 1)
- [x] Leaf 1 rung 1: Shamir k-of-n, unforgeable `Secret` (E0451), GF(256) toy backend
- [x] Gates green: 10 unit + 3 doctests, clippy -D warnings, rustdoc -D warnings, fmt
- [x] CHARTER.md (two tracks + graduation criteria + Sol wiring), README
- [x] First commit (`d0bfc3b`, local, on `main`)
- [x] Push to GitHub — **public** at https://github.com/modelmiser/corona

## Next (leaf 1)

- [x] Cold-review the rung-1 surface to convergence — 5 rounds (MOD 3→1→1→0→0),
      two consecutive clean rounds. Fixes: redacting `Debug`, caller-chosen-k
      disclosure (+ test), live `combine_with` seam (+ test), thesis/wiring precision.
- [ ] `split` that takes an RNG (feature-gated) so the happy path isn't coeff-by-hand,
      while keeping `split_with_coeffs` as the deterministic/testable primitive
- [x] Decide: base for VSS rung 2 (chosen) → seeded `vss-types` (leaf 2)

## Now (leaf 2 — vss-types)

- [x] Seed VSS rung 2: Feldman verifiable secret sharing, sealed `VerifiedShare`
      (E0451) via `Commitment::verify`, threshold pinned by commitment length.
      Closes leaf 1's two limits. 12 unit + 2 doctests; full-workspace gates green.
- [x] `corona-core` promotion check (leaf-2 trigger): only `Threshold` stays shared;
      redacting-`Secret` kept per-leaf (semantically distinct). See CHARTER.
- [x] Cold-review the leaf-2 surface to convergence — 3 rounds (MOD 3→0→0), two
      consecutive clean rounds. Round 1 caught a REAL bug (non-canonical share
      index aliasing → f_inv(0)); fixed with a `verify` canonicalization guard +
      regression test. Rest were gap-characterization precision.
- [x] Brand `VerifiedShare` (bind to issuing `Commitment`) — DONE via an invariant
      *generative lifetime* (`deal_scoped`'s `for<'brand>` closure). Cross-commitment
      `recover` no longer compiles. NOTE: realized as a lifetime brand (zero-dep,
      forbid-unsafe), so the diagnostic is a *lifetime error*, not literally E0308
      (literal E0308 needs nominal type brands, un-mintable fresh per value in safe
      Rust — the lifetime diagnostic is inherent; see the WITHDRAWN note below).
- [x] Cold-review the branded leaf-2 surface to convergence — 3 rounds (MOD 3→0→0),
      two consecutive clean rounds. Branding proven sound (4 rejected exploit crates).
      Fixes: sealed `interpolate_at_zero` value-bypass + type-vs-value disclosure;
      corrected the generativity/E0308 counterfactual; `f_inv` hard-assert; MSRV pin.
- [x] ~~offer a `generativity`-backed literal-E0308 variant~~ — WITHDRAWN: the
      generativity crate also brands with lifetimes → also a lifetime error, NOT literal
      E0308. Literal E0308 needs nominal type brands (not mintable fresh per value in
      safe Rust). The lifetime diagnostic is inherent; no cleaner path exists.

## Now (leaf 3 — erasure-types)

- [x] Seed erasure-types: Reed–Solomon k-of-n erasure coding, sealed `RecoveredData`
      (E0451, non-redacting — the deliberate paired-axis contrast to `Secret`), systematic
      encode + Lagrange erasure decode over GF(256). 9 unit + 2 doctests; gates green.
- [x] `corona-core` promotion check (leaf-3 trigger): **GF(256) now shared by leaf 1 +
      leaf 3** → real promotion candidate. FLAGGED, not done (would refactor converged
      `threshold-types`). See CHARTER.
- [x] Cold-review the leaf-3 surface to convergence — 3 rounds (MOD 2→0→0), two
      consecutive clean rounds. ZERO correctness/soundness defects; all findings were
      thesis-precision (RS-is-Shamir over-claim → "same machinery, msg in evaluations
      not coefficients"; "axis invisible to the types" → invisible to the seal, visible
      in the API by convention; seal = typestate token not availability proof). Sealed
      gf256 arithmetic pub(crate).
- [x] Promote `gf256` → `corona-core` — DONE. Both leaves import `corona_core::gf256`;
      local copies deleted; canonical version = `pub` + hard `assert!`. The first
      primitive to graduate out of a leaf (thin-core rule fired at the 2nd sharing).
- [x] Error-correcting Reed–Solomon — SEEDED as `decode_correcting` (Berlekamp–Welch
      in `ecc` module) + sealed `CorrectedData`. Corrects ≤⌊(m−k)/2⌋ unknown-position
      errors; detects beyond. Integrity vs bounded corruption, NOT authentication.
- [x] Cold-review `decode_correcting` — CONVERGED (practical: 5 rounds, MOD 0→1→0→1→0,
      soundness proven 5× with ZERO correctness/soundness defects). Fixes were all
      doc-precision: CorrectedData provenance-not-correctness framing; the adversary
      threshold, which took 3 iterations to land airtight (m−t reviewer-wrong → t+1
      mine-wrong-for-odd → **d−t** = ⌈(m−k)/2⌉+1, independently re-derived correct).

## Now (leaf 4 — merkle-types)

- [x] Seed merkle-types: Merkle inclusion proofs as typestate. E0451-sealed
      `VerifiedLeaf` minted only by `Root::verify` (fold the authentication path,
      compare to root). First leaf **off the polynomial substrate** (hash tree, not
      field interpolation) → confirms the seal is **substrate-agnostic** (same
      reduction as VSS's `Commitment::verify`/`VerifiedShare`, different mechanism).
      First leaf importing **nothing** from `corona-core` → separates shared *code*
      (core modules) from the shared *discipline* (the primitives). TOY FNV hash
      (domain-separated leaf/node tags); promotes odd nodes (avoids CVE-2012-2459).
      10 unit + 1 doctest; full-workspace gates green (50 unit + 10 doctests).
- [x] `corona-core` promotion check (leaf-4 trigger): **nothing to promote** — and
      that's the finding (uses neither `Threshold` nor `gf256`). Core stays thin.
      See CHARTER.
- [x] Cold-review the leaf-4 surface to convergence — 6 rounds, practical
      convergence (round 6 clean at zero severity on both lenses; code frozen and
      clean from the round-1 fix onward). Round-1 MODERATE (real): `proof.index`
      unauthenticated → dropped the redundant `on_left` side flag, `verify` now
      derives shape from `(index, size)` and binds `index` into the fold. Rounds 2-5
      sharpened the index-symmetry claim to the exact group-orbit characterization
      (confirmed accepted-set == orbit across 13.7M acceptances). merkle 10→12 unit;
      workspace 50→52. Commit `b4f451b`.
- [x] Rung 2: brand `VerifiedLeaf` to its issuing `Root` via an invariant generative
      lifetime — DONE (`36c6e99`). `Root<'brand>` + `VerifiedLeaf<'brand>` carry a
      `PhantomData<fn(&'brand())->&'brand()>` brand introduced by `commit_scoped`'s
      `for<'brand>` closure; same-brand consumer `Root::authenticated_positions`
      accepts only this root's witnesses → cross-root is a compile error (verified: a
      lifetime error + E0521, not literal E0308, as in vss). `build` → private
      `build_inner` behind `commit_scoped` (sole entry, keeps the brand generative).
      Leaf 4 now uses TWO garden primitives (E0451 + brand), no new one. merkle 12
      unit + 2 doctests (added a `compile_fail`); workspace 52 unit + 11 doctests.
- [x] Cold-review the branded rung-2 surface to convergence — 2 consecutive clean
      rounds (MOD 0→0), ZERO findings, ZERO changes: the brand was correct as
      committed (`36c6e99`). Brand proven SOUND by adversarial *compilation* — ~24
      exploit crates across two rounds (scope-escape, cross-brand launder via
      variance/`RefCell`/`Any`/trait-object/GAT/fn-ptr, safe-code forge, `'static`
      coercion) all compiler-rejected; positive controls hold. Cross-root = lifetime
      error + E0521 (not E0308), compiler-confirmed. `commit_scoped` grep-confirmed
      sole `Root` constructor. (Mechanism-copy of vss's proven brand → converged in
      the minimum 2 rounds vs vss's 3.)

## Parking lot additions (optional, not scheduled)

- Parity nicety (NOT a finding — two claims lenses cleared it): add a `compile_fail`
  sealed-constructor doctest so merkle's E0451 claim is self-testing like vss's. The
  cross-brand `compile_fail` already exists; this would cover the seal too.

## Now (leaf 5 — lamport-types)

- [x] Seed lamport-types: Lamport one-time signatures as typestate. The first leaf
      whose central primitive is **E0382 (move-linearity)**, not the E0451 seal — a
      `SigningKey` is a linear/affine capability, `sign(self)` consumes it, so
      double-signing does not compile (verified: `error[E0382]: use of moved value`).
      Keeps an E0451 seal (`VerifiedMessage` from `verify`) + redacting `Debug` on the
      secret key. Honest nuance documented: Rust moves are affine (at-most-once), which
      is exactly OTS's need. Imports nothing from corona-core (∥ merkle). 9 unit + 2
      doctests (happy path + one-time-key `compile_fail`); workspace 61 unit + 13
      doctests, all gates green.
- [x] `corona-core` promotion check (leaf-5 trigger): nothing to promote (hash-based,
      single-signer). Contribution is *primitive coverage* — E0382 now centrally used;
      only E0080 remains unexercised as a leaf's core. See CHARTER.
- [ ] Cold-review the leaf-5 surface to convergence. Focus: the E0382 linearity claim
      (can a double-sign be smuggled past the move — Clone/re-borrow/`&self` variant?);
      the affine-not-linear framing; the reuse-vs-forgery separation; toy-hash honesty.

## Parking lot (garden, not scheduled)

- Lean formalization of a graduated leaf → contribute to Sol (the garden↔Sol wiring)
- Further domains off the polynomial substrate: threshold signatures, a fountain/LT
  code, a cryptographic accumulator — each a fresh test of the vocabulary.
