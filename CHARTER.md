# Corona — charter

*A garden of typestate crates that encode a domain's invariants through one small
vocabulary of compile-time primitives. Corona is the **type** face of the Radiant
verification work; [Sol](../../active/sol) is the **proof** face. They are wired,
not merged (see "Relationship to Sol").*

## Why "garden"

The unit that gets *finished* here is the **research loop on one crate**, not the
garden. quorum-types could cleanly declare itself thesis-complete and wind down
precisely because it was a complete thought. The garden is the **shelf you place
finished things on** — it is deliberately open-ended, and that has to be fine.
"The garden is never done" is a feature, not a debt.

## The shared vocabulary

Every leaf expresses its invariants through the same handful of compile-time
primitives first isolated in `warp-types`/`quorum-types`:

- **E0451 — sealed unforgeability.** A private field / no public constructor, so
  a value can only arrive through a checked path.
- **E0382 — move-linearity.** A capability consumed exactly once.
- **E0308 — brand unification.** Distinct phantom brands that must match.
- **E0080 — const-eval wall.** A monotone-arithmetic invariant enforced at
  compile time.

`corona-core` holds only what is **genuinely shared across ≥ 2 leaves**. It grows
when a second leaf proves a primitive is common — never speculatively from one
example. Today it is exactly `Threshold` (the k-of-n gate).

## Two tracks

A crate is always on exactly one track, stated in its own README:

| | **Research (toy)** | **Graduated (production-intent)** |
|---|---|---|
| Goal | test whether a domain reduces to the vocabulary | be depended on for real work |
| Backend | may be hand-rolled/illustrative | **vetted dependency only** (no hand-rolled crypto) |
| Honesty | loud "TOY — not for real use" banner | documented security posture |
| Versioning | pre-1.0, may churn | semver commitment |
| Maintenance | may be wound down when thesis-complete | CVE/issue response tail accepted |
| Machine-checking | tests + optional out-of-tree provers | tests + shipped verification |

Most leaves stay research toys — that is a **success**, not a failure. A toy that
answers its question and winds down is a finished thought.

### Graduation criteria (research → production)

A crate graduates only when **all** hold:

1. Its thesis question is answered and recorded (DEVLOG/INSIGHTS).
2. Every illustrative backend is replaced by a vetted dependency behind the
   *same* types — the graduation seam is a **trait swap, not a rewrite** (e.g.
   `threshold-types::Reconstruct`).
3. A security/limits section states what the types do and do **not** witness.
4. It carries a Lean formalization contributed to Sol (see below), or an explicit
   note of why it cannot.
5. Cold review converges (2 clean rounds) on the graduated surface.

Graduation is a **deliberate, announced** flip — never a silent drift of a toy
into load-bearing use.

## Relationship to Sol

Corona and [Sol](../../active/sol) are two faces of the same fundamentals:

- **Corona** encodes invariants as *executable Rust types* (this repo).
- **Sol** proves those invariants as *machine-checked Lean lemmas*; its thesis is
  that AI proof search is bottlenecked by representation, and it grows a lemma
  library from worked domains. Its Rust workspace (`sol-verify*`) is verification
  **tooling**, not a home for domain crates.

`warp-types` already lives at both — a Rust crate here, a Lean formalization that
is one of Sol's test beds. The intended flow is **one-directional: a graduated
Corona leaf contributes a Lean formalization to Sol** (domains feed lemmas). A
`threshold-types` crate does **not** belong in Sol's `sol-verify` workspace — that
would mix domain types with verification tooling. Keep them distinct-but-wired.

## Leaves

| Crate | Track | Domain | Thesis question |
|---|---|---|---|
| `corona-core` | infra | shared vocabulary | — (grows only with a 2nd leaf) |
| `threshold-types` | research (toy) | Shamir k-of-n secret sharing | does crypto threshold evidence reduce to the vocabulary? → **counting half: yes** |

### Lineage (the pattern that predates the plan)

`warp-types` (GPU/local invariants) → `quorum-types` (distributed generalization)
→ `threshold-types` (cryptographic thresholds). Corona names the family these
three already form; it is recognition, not new scope.

### Candidate future leaves

- `erasure-types` — Reed–Solomon k-of-n. Same reconstruction skeleton as Shamir,
  opposite property (*availability*, not confidentiality). The paired axis.
- Verifiable secret sharing — adds commitments so shares become *authenticable*;
  the natural rung 2 that closes the gap `threshold-types` documents.

## Records

Per the ecosystem convention, `DEVLOG.md`, `DEVLOG/`, `INSIGHTS.md`, and
`INSIGHTS/` are gitignored working memory. `TODO.md` at the repo root is the
single source of truth for outstanding work.
